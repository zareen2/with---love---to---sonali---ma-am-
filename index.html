    <h1>With Love, To Sonali Ma'am</h1>

    <p>Hello Maâ€™am,</p>
    <p>
      I've been reflecting on the time I spent at the school, and I truly appreciate the guidance and support. 
      I often think about how beautifully and efficiently the environment was run under your leadership. 
      You brought calm, discipline, and a warm presence that shaped so many young minds, including mine.
    </p>

    <h2>âœ¨ A Few Words Just for You âœ¨</h2>
    <p>
      You are more than a principal â€” you are an inspiration. Your grace, dedication, and unwavering support touched us all. 
      Every morning, your smile set the tone for the day. Your strength and wisdom were like anchors for both students and staff.
    </p>

    <h2>ðŸŒ¸ A Short Poem for You ðŸŒ¸</h2>
    <p class="poem">
      In the halls where dreams took flight,<br>
      You were our calm, our guiding light.<br>
      With words so kind, and vision wide,<br>
      You walked with strength and humble pride.<br>
      <br>
      Though Iâ€™ve moved on, your lessons stay,<br>
      Guiding me in every way.<br>
      Thank you, Maâ€™am, for all you doâ€”<br>
      The worldâ€™s much brighter, thanks to you.
    </p>
